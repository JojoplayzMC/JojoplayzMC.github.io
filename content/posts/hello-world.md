## Welcome to my Blog
This is my first post on **TechByJoe**. I'll be posting about:
* C# and Python projects
* Arduino hardware hacks
* PC building tips

### C# Logic Test
Here is a quick snippet of C# to check the syntax colors:

```csharp
using System;

public class TechByJoe {
    public static void Main() {
        string status = "Building...";
        Console.WriteLine($"Status: {status}");
    }
}
```
So what do you think?
